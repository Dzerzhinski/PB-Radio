1. Install the Anaconda Python distribution.  
 -- Go to https://www.anaconda.org/distribution/ and click on the "Download" button in the center of the page.  
-- Up at the top is a list of platforms, "Windows | macOS | Linux".  Choose the appropriate one.  
-- Select the "Download" button under Python 3.7 version.
-- Download and install the program as prompted.  The default options will be sufficient.

2. Download the prototype code.
-- Go to https://github.com/Dzerzhinski/PB-Radio/.
-- Halfway down the page, towards the right side of the screen, is a green button labeled "Clone or Download".  Select that button.
-- It will open a small window.  Select "Download ZIP".
-- Download the compressed file.
-- Navigate to your downloads folder and Extract/unzip the file.

3. Run the prototype code.
-- From the start menu, select "Anaconda3 (64-bit)", then "Jupyter Notebook".  This is the program used to prototype the code and is very useful for small calculations and note-taking, as well as programming and analysis.
-- Jupyter will open a browser tab (in Chrome or Edge) that shows your file system.  Navigate to the folder from step 2 (probably "Downloads", then "PB-Radio-Master".
-- Select "dial-proto-new.ipynb".  It will open in a new tab.
-- From the menu near the top of the window, select "Cell", then select "Run Cells" from the menu.  If you scroll down, you should see the prototype code running.
